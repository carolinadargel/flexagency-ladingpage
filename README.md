# project flexbox DIO

This project was developed to parctice flexbox concepts in different forms and shapes, for the Digital Innovation One frontend Bootcamp.

The general idea is to build a landing page for a tourism agency using images, text and buttons following the flexbox best practices, allowing this page to be render whether in desktop or mobile screens, with excellent usability.

Thanks for stopping by!
